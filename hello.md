## Introduction

### 1. The Disruptive Emergence of Large Language Models in Higher Education

The rapid and widespread integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, represents a watershed moment in the history of higher education. These generative artificial intelligence tools possess unprecedented capabilities in synthesizing complex information, structuring arguments, and producing sophisticated textual outputs that often meet or exceed the standards of traditional academic assignments. While LLMs offer transformative potential for personalized learning, research assistance, and content creation, their emergence has simultaneously precipitated a profound crisis in the established mechanisms of academic evaluation (Perkins & Hafner, 2024). The core challenge lies 
in maintaining the validity and integrity of assessment when the cognitive labor required to produce the final deliverable can be outsourced to an artificial intelligence.

### 2. The Assessment Reliability Crisis: From Product to Proxy

For decades, academic assessment has largely operated under a **product-based** paradigm, where student learning is inferred primarily from the quality, structure, and content of a final deliverable—be it an essay, a research report, or a code submission. This model assumes a direct, reliable correlation between the quality of the product and the student’s mastery of the Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs). The advent of LLMs fundamentally compromises this assumption. When an LLM can generate a high-quality, academically sound product, the final output ceases to be a reliable indicator of the student’s individual cognitive engagement, critical analysis, or synthesis skills (Cotton & Gannon, 2023). This decoupling of output quality from student effort has created an **Assessment Reliability Crisis**, challenging the foundational principles of **Constructive Alignment** (Biggs, 1996) where assessment tasks must verify the achievement 
of specific learning goals.

The theoretical response to this crisis necessitates a pivot toward **Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)**, as defined by revised taxonomies of learning (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001). LLMs excel at lower-order tasks such as remembering, understanding, and even applying and analyzing information. Consequently, assessment must shift its focus to the higher-order domains of **Evaluating** (judging the quality and bias of LLM-generated content) and **Creating** (designing novel solutions or arguments that require situated judgment and unique insight).

### 3. The Paradigm Shift: Prioritizing Process and Metacognition

This thesis posits that the only sustainable and academically rigorous response to the LLM challenge is a fundamental 
paradigm shift: moving assessment strategies **From Product to Process**. This shift requires educators to move beyond evaluating the final artifact and instead focus on verifying the student’s cognitive journey, the iterative steps taken, and the metacognitive awareness demonstrated throughout the learning task.

**Process Assessment** is rooted in the principle that verifiable learning occurs through documented stages of planning, drafting, critiquing, and revising. By requiring students to document their use of LLMs (e.g., through prompt logs, AI use statements) and to articulate their rationale for accepting, rejecting, or modifying AI-generated content, the assessment targets the student’s ability to manage, critique, and apply knowledge—skills that are inherently human and resistant to automation. This approach re-establishes the validity of assessment by making the student’s critical engagement, rather than the final output, the primary object of evaluation.

### 4. Thesis Statement and Research Objectives

This thesis argues that the integration of Large Language Models necessitates a fundamental re-alignment of assessment strategies, proposing a comprehensive framework that prioritizes **process-based, metacognitive, and LLM-resistant assessment models** to ensure the validity and integrity of academic evaluation in the digital age.

To support this argument, this research pursues the following objectives:
1.  To critically review the theoretical foundations of assessment (e.g., Constructive Alignment, Authentic Assessment) and analyze how LLMs challenge their core tenets.
2.  To systematically categorize and evaluate emerging LLM-resistant assessment strategies, including hybrid models (e.g., Draft and Defend) and situated knowledge tasks.
3.  To develop and propose a novel, multi-phased framework for process-based assessment that integrates mandatory metacognitive reflection and verifiable scaffolding.
4.  To provide practical recommendations for the institutional implementation of this framework, addressing issues of 
academic policy, faculty training, and technological infrastructure.

### 5. Structure of the Thesis

The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows: Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive literature review on the theoretical underpinnings of assessment and the pedagogical implications of generative AI. Chapter 3 analyzes current institutional responses and categorizes existing LLM-resistant assessment strategies. Chapter 4 details the proposed **Process-Based Assessment Framework**, outlining its theoretical justification and practical components. Chapter 5 discusses the implications of this framework for academic integrity, equity, and future pedagogical practice. Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes the findings, reiterates the central argument, and suggests avenues for future research.
